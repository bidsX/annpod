# AnnPOD

Analyzes data from Piazza through velocity and keyword checking through a 
visual interface

This requires a database from [Piazza-Scraper](https://github.com/bidsX/piazza-scraper) and analyzed by [Piazza-Analyzer](https://github.com/bidsX/piazza-analyzer).

# Installation

Create a conda environment using

	conda create --name ENV_NAME python=3.4

Install from the list of requirements.


	pip install -r requirements.txt

# How to Run

To run the visualization, do the following. We assume that you have already started your conda environment using

	source activate ENV_NAME

1) If the database hasn't already been created (e.g. this is the first time you are running the scraper), run the scraper, and copy the database over to this directory.

2) To run the visualization, run the server and load the webpage: localhost:5000

	python -i server.py
